Hash table is a data structure that stores data in a key-value method. The key is a string that is hashed to return an index withing the size of the hash table. The index is used to store the corresponding value in a bucket. If different keys hashed to the same index, a linked list is used to chain the value to avoid collision. The chain maintains the index, however, data are stored in the next available empty bucket

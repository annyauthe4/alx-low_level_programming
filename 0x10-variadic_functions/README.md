Variadic functions in C are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. These functions use the ellipsis (...) notation in their parameter list to indicate that they can accept an arbitrary number of arguments of different types. Variadic functions are typically used in situations where the number of arguments cannot be determined at compile time and can vary from one function call to another.
